# MIT OCW 6.002 - My Learning Journey

I'm studying MIT's Circuits and Electronics course (6.002) through OpenCourseWare.  
I'm not an expert — I'm just starting, and many things are confusing.  
This repository is my **learning journey**, not a finished product.

I'll be posting:
- Questions I had while watching lectures
- Concepts I didn’t understand and how I researched them
- Useful videos or articles I found
- Small notes when something "clicked"

I hope this can help others who are also self-studying and struggling to understand this complex topic.
