Today, I started the MIT OpenCourseWare with a video lecture by Professor Anant Agarwal. And I instantly got stuck on some concepts: *“What the heck is Maxwell’s equation?”*, *“What does op-amp mean?”*, *“Abstraction? Amplifier? Lumped?”*

DeepSeek and ChatGPT told me that I don’t need to completely understand Maxwell’s equations to take 6.002 (Circuits and Electronics). But I can’t accept what I don’t know — it’s just my nature to fully understand everything I encounter (sometimes it’s annoying, but that’s how I am). Students taking the course seem to already know all the things Professor Agarwal mentions. So, I spent my first day breaking down two of Maxwell’s equations and trying to understand some key abstractions.

### Basic Knowledge Required for the First Lecture

#### Ohm’s Law
\[
I = \frac{V}{R}
\]
Current equals voltage divided by resistance.

---

#### Kirchhoff’s Laws

**KVL (Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law)**  
The sum of the electrical potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop is zero.  
*Put simply: if you walk around a closed circuit loop, the voltage gains and drops must cancel out.*

**KCL (Kirchhoff’s Current Law)**  
The total current entering a junction (node) is equal to the total current leaving the junction.  
*Put simply: at any point where wires connect, what flows in must flow out.*

### Where I Got Stuck

#### Maxwell-Faraday Equation (One of Maxwell’s Equations)

\[
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
\]

This is the **Maxwell-Faraday equation**.  
- \( \mathbf{E} \) represents the electric field.  
- \( \mathbf{B} \) represents the magnetic field.  
- \( \nabla \times \mathbf{E} \) is the **curl** of the electric field.  
- \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \) is the **rate of change** of the magnetic field with respect to time.

This equation tells us that a changing magnetic field induces a circulating electric field.  
In words: **“The line integral of the electric field around a closed loop equals the negative time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.”**

#### Gauss’s Law for Magnetism (Another Maxwell Equation)

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
\]

- The upside-down triangle (∇) represents the **divergence** operator.  
- This equation says: *“The divergence of the magnetic field is zero.”*

In simpler terms: magnetic field lines have **no beginning or end** — there is no magnetic monopole. Magnetic field lines always form **closed loops**.

Imagine arrows filling space, all connecting end-to-end in a loop. That’s a magnetic field.

### Closing Note

This is my first post, where I try to explain two of Maxwell’s equations. I will continue until the day I fully understand 6.002. I’m just a student who is learning. I might make many mistakes, so if you read this post, please read it critically — and I’d be deeply grateful for any feedback or corrections.
